#A quick program for back-calculating statistics for BeamGen from Ultra-Tech stats.


# E, the weight constant

D = 6.0		#Dice of damage
W = 20.0	#Weight (empty?)
F = 0.8		#Focal array
G = 1.0		#Generator

E = D/((W*F*G)**(1/3))
print(E)

##

# Rb, the base range for the beam

HalfRange = D^2*Rb*Rf

Rb = HalfRange/(Rf*D^2)

##

# Shots base

Shots = (Base*CellNo*CellMod)/D^3

Base = (Shots*D^3)/(CellNo*CellMod)

##

# Bc, the beam cost

Cost = EmptyWeight*Bc*Gc

Bc = Cost/(EmptyWeight*Gc)

Gc = 1.0
